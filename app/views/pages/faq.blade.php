		  <div class="panel-heading"><strong>How does it work?</strong></div>
		  <div class="panel-body">
			After you registred your account and verified it, you can start generating random quests or quests for specific champions and roles. Each Quest will give you EXP (Experience) for your User Level and QP (Quest Points) for unlocking <a href="/shop">rewards in our shop</a>.<br/>
			<br/>
			Only matched games will count for fulfilling your quest. So as example Custom Games won't work for completing quests.
